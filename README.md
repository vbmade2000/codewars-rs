# What is codewars-rs ?
**codewars-rs** is [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) crate to access [codewars](www.codewars.com) REST API. 

# Features
- Retrieve Codewars User data
- Retrieve Challenges authored by a user
- Retrieve Challenges completed by a user
- Retrieve data for a particular challenge

# Limitations
There is no official specification available for presence of REST API fields in the output of APIs so there is a possibility for error if some field is not present. In that case you can create a issue.  

# TODOs
- Add examples
- Refactore code
